    """
    Creates a stage that maps a function `f` over the data. Its intended to behave like python's built-in `map` function but with the added concurrency.

    ```python
    import pypeln as pl
    import time
    from random import random

    def slow_add1(x):
        time.sleep(random()) # <= some slow computation
        return x + 1

    data = range(10) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9]
    stage = pl.thread.map(slow_add1, data, workers=3, maxsize=4)

    data = list(stage) # e.g. [2, 1, 5, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    ```

    !!! note
        Because of concurrency order is not guaranteed. 

    Arguments:
        f: A function with the signature `f(x) -> y`. `f` can accept special additional arguments by name as described in [Advanced Usage](https://cgarciae.github.io/pypeln/advanced/#dependency-injection).
        stage: A Stage or Iterable.
        workers: The number of workers the stage should contain.
        maxsize: The maximum number of objects the stage can hold simultaneously, if set to `0` (default) then the stage can grow unbounded.
        timeout: Seconds before stoping the worker if its current task is not yet completed. Defaults to `0` which means its unbounded. 
        on_start: A function with signature `on_start(worker_info?) -> kwargs?`, where `kwargs` can be a `dict` of keyword arguments that can be consumed by `f` and `on_done`. `on_start` can accept additional arguments by name as described in [Advanced Usage](https://cgarciae.github.io/pypeln/advanced/#dependency-injection).
        on_done: A function with signature `on_done(stage_status?)`. This function is executed once per worker when the worker finishes. `on_done` can accept additional arguments by name as described in [Advanced Usage](https://cgarciae.github.io/pypeln/advanced/#dependency-injection).

    Returns:
        Returns a `Stage` if the `stage` parameters is given, else it returns a `Partial`.
